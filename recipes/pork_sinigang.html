<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for
  additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you can add what
  Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they look
  like potatoes. You can add five to six of them when you add the water and make
  sure they are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked because they
  can get too soft.
